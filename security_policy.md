# The Lab @ DC Data Security Policy

The work of The Lab @ DC ("the Lab") often involves confidential or sensitive information. This document outlines the Lab’s procedures for working with data at all different levels of confidentiality and sensitivity and ensuring the protection of data.

## General Security Controls Employed by All Lab Staff

* All data analysis must be conducted on District-issued computers.

* All District-issued computers on which data analysis is conducted must:

* Run Windows 10 to facilitate encryption;

* Use full disk encryption (using Check Point endpoint security);

* Be password-protected; and

* Have the computer screen set to automatically lock and require a password to re-open after 5 minutes of inactivity.

* All users must use a password that is not used elsewhere by the user and a password manager to access other analytic tools.

* All users must lock their computer screens and require a password to re-open whenever they leave a District-issued laptop unattended outside of a District government facility.

* When using a Wi-Fi connection (other than the secure Wi-Fi connection operated by the District government), all users shall comply with the following guidelines:

* The user shall not use an unsecured public Wi-Fi connection unless such use is absolutely necessary (for example, the user’s hotel only provides an unsecured Wi-Fi connection and it is necessary for the user to perform work while at the hotel);

* The user shall immediately connect to the DC VPN (regardless of whether the Wi-Fi connection is secure or unsecure);

* To the extent feasible, the user shall avoid accessing or analyzing Level 3 or Level 4 data when connected to a public Wi-Fi connection, even if the user is connected to the DC VPN and even if the Wi-Fi connection is secured; and

* The user shall ensure that his or her home network uses WPA2 authentication.

## Level 0: Open Data

*Description*:  Level 0 data refers to all datasets not designated by an agency as being level 1 to level 4.

*Example*:  Certificates of occupancy are determinations by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) that the use of a building, structure, or land in the District conforms to zoning regulations and building codes. This dataset would not be designated by DCRA as Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 and therefore would be considered Level 0. Moreover, any dataset regularly published in machine-readable format on opendata.dc.gov or another dc.gov website prior to this Order is considered “Level 0, Open” unless an agency makes a proactive determination to raise the classification.

*Protections*:  The Lab will not provide any protections for Level 0 data.

*Publication*:  There are no restrictions on the publication of Level 0 data.

*Sharing*:  There are no restrictions on sharing Level 0 data.

*Disposal*:  There are no requirements to dispose of Level 0 data.


## Level 1: Public, Not Proactively Released

*Description*:  Level 1 data refers to a dataset that is not protected from public disclosure or subject to withholding under any law (including the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”)), regulation, or contract. Nevertheless, publication of the dataset on the public Internet and exposure to search engines would:

* Have the potential to jeopardize the safety, privacy, or security of residents, agency workforce members, clients, partners, or anyone else identified in the information;

* Require subjective redaction;

* Impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the agency; or

* Expose the District to litigation or legal liability.

*Example*: The Board of Elections (BOE) maintains a voter file, which traditionally is public data, and in fact the BOE is required by law to “publish and display on its website … a searchable copy of the list of qualified voters.” The law does not state that the entire file, including voter history, must be posted. Under this policy, BOE could declare the voter history to be “public but not proactively released.”

*Protections*:   Level 1 datasets may be transferred by District government email, flash drive, or the Lab’s secure upload facility. No other protections are required for Level 1 data.  Level 1 datasets may be printed, but the printouts will be shredded when they are no longer needed.

*Publication*:  If Level 1 datasets are used in a published document, the data may be made available with the document, but will be made anonymous and any data described in paragraphs 1-4 of the Description section above will be removed before being published.

*Sharing*:  Level 1 data may be shared freely within the District government.  Level 1 data will not be actively shared outside the District government directly or otherwise (e.g., by posting the data online), except as described in the Publication section above and as described in this section for replication purposes.  If OCA receives a request for Level 1 data from a party outside the government, OCA will inform the data owner of the request and refer the requesting party to the data owner to request the data.  If, despite the referral, the requesting party continues to request that OCA provide the data, OCA will confer with the data owner to ensure that appropriate precautions are taken (for example, subjective redactions) before the data is shared.  OCA may share Level 1 data with an outside party for replication purposes.  When Level 1 data is shared for replication purposes, OCA shall take appropriate steps to ensure that sensitive or confidential data is not unnecessarily shared and to ensure that the outside party appropriately protects and disposes of the data.

*Disposal*:  There are no requirements for OCA to dispose of Level 1 data unless specified by the data owner in a data use agreement with OCA.


## Level 2: For District Government Use

*Description*:  Level 2 data refers to a dataset that the originating agency determines is subject to one or more FOIA exemptions, is not highly sensitive, and may be distributed within the District government without restriction by law, regulation, or contract.

Example:  OCTO licenses commercial data on businesses operating in the District. The license prohibits the public distribution of the data, and proprietary restrictions qualify as a FOIA exemption. Nevertheless, the data has widespread utility within the government, including for economic development and emergency management, and therefore would be classified as Level 2.

*Protections*:  Unless otherwise specified by the data owner in a data use agreement with OCA, Lab staff may transfer Level 2 datasets or any derivatives of Level 2 datasets by District government email, flash drive, or the Lab’s secure upload facility. However, some contracts have additional provisions that may apply (for example, the contract may require that the data must be accessed through certain interfaces). The data owner is responsible for notifying the Lab if any such restrictions exist (although the Lab intends to actively solicit this information as well) and for including those restrictions in the data use agreement with OCA.  If Level 2 data is transferred via flash drive, the data will be deleted immediately from the flash drive after the transfer is complete and the deletion will be confirmed by ensuring that the data does not appear in the trash or recycle bin of the flash drive. Any Level 2 data that is printed will be stored in a locked file cabinet when the data is not in use and will be shredded when it is no longer needed.

*Publication*:  The aggregate results and conclusions from OCA’s analysis of Level 2 data may be published or presented to the general public.  However raw data from Level 2 datasets will not be used in a published document or a presentation unless the publication or presentation of such information is agreed to by the data owner.

*Sharing*:  Unless prohibited by a contract, Level 2 data may be shared with other District government employees, contractors, and agents, but it may not be shared with an individual outside the District government either directly or otherwise (for example, by posting the data online).  If OCA receives a request for Level 2 data from a party outside the government, OCA will inform the data owner of the request and refer the requesting party to the data owner.  OCA will not share the data with the outside party upon such a request.  If OCA seeks to share the data with an outside party (for example, for replication purposes) the sharing of the data must be approved in writing by the data owner before the data may be shared by OCA, unless such sharing is authorized by the data use agreement between the data owner and OCA.  When Level 2 data is shared with an outside party, OCA shall take appropriate steps to ensure that sensitive or confidential is not unnecessarily shared and to ensure that the outside party appropriately protects and disposes of the data.

*Disposal*:  There are no requirements for OCA to dispose of Level 2 data unless specified by the data owner in a data use agreement with OCA.


## Level 3: Confidential
*Description*:  Level 3 data refers to a dataset that the originating agency has determined is protected from disclosure by law, including FOIA, regulation, or contract and that is either highly sensitive or is restricted by law, by regulation, or by contract from disclosure to other public bodies. Such datasets generally include datasets that contain data that qualifies for designation by a federal agency or District agency as:
Attorney-Client Privileged;
Criminal Justice Information;
Critical Infrastructure Information;
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA);
Federal Tax Information (FTI);
For Official Use Only (FOUO);
Law Enforcement Sensitive;
Legally privileged;
Payment Card Information (PCI); or
Protected Health Information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA);
Sensitive but Unclassified.


Examples:  “Personally identifiable information” (PII) would generally be designated as Level 3, but not always. For example, property records contain owner names and addresses but are traditionally public data and not protected from disclosure under FOIA. On the other hand, the public library tracks the books and materials borrowed by patrons so that it can ensure the return of those assets. Disclosure of what material was borrowed by which patron(s) would violate the personal privacy of the patron and is therefore exempted from mandatory disclosure by FOIA.

*Protections*:  Level 3 data will only be stored and accessed on an encrypted computer. Lab staff will not email, post online, or otherwise make Level 3 data available through unencrypted channels.  Level 3 data will be transferred between computers by using an encrypted flash drive or the Lab’s secure upload facility. If Level 3 data is transferred via flash drive, the data will be deleted immediately from the flash drive after the transfer is complete and the deletion will be confirmed by ensuring that the data does not appear in the trash or recycle bin of the flash drive. Any data that is printed will be stored in a locked file cabinet and shredded when it is no longer needed.

*Publication*:  Unless otherwise specified in a data use agreement with the data owner, the Lab may publish and present the aggregate results and conclusions of its analyses of Level 3 data to the general public; provided that:

The publication or presentation of results and conclusions shall not include personally identifiable information;

The publication or presentation of results and conclusions shall not include raw Level 2, 3, or 4 confidential or sensitive information, unless the publication or presentation of such information is agreed to by the data owner; and

The publication or presentation has been reviewed by the data owner as specified by the data use agreement with between the data owner and OCA.

*Sharing*:  Level 3 data may only be shared with other Lab staff; OCA staff, contractors, and agents; and any individuals who are authorized to receive the data by the data use agreement between the data owner and OCA.  If OCA receives a request for Level 3 data from a party outside the government, OCA will inform the data owner of the request and refer the requesting party to the data owner.  OCA will not share the data with the outside party upon such a request.  If OCA seeks to share the data with an outside party (for example, for replication purposes) the sharing of the data must be approved in writing by the data owner before the dataset may be shared by OCA, unless such sharing is authorized by the data use agreement between the data owner and OCA.  When Level 3 data is shared by OCA, OCA shall take appropriate steps to ensure that sensitive or confidential is not unnecessarily shared and to ensure that the outside party appropriately protects and disposes of the data.

*Disposal*: Upon finishing the Lab’s work with Level 3 datasets, Lab staff will dispose of the data as specified by the data use agreement with the data owner.


## Level 4: Restricted Confidential

*Description*:  Level 4 data refers to datasets for which the originating agency has determined that unauthorized disclosure could potentially cause major damage or injury, including death, to residents, agency workforce members, clients, partners, stakeholders, or others identified in the information, or otherwise significantly impair the ability of the agency to perform its statutory functions. Includes any dataset designated by a federal agency to be at the level of “Confidential” or higher under the federal government’s system for marking classified information.

*Protections*:  If Level 4 data is shared pursuant to a data use agreement between the data owner and OCA, specific security protocols to ensure the protection of the data will be included in the Agreement.

*Publication*:  Level 4 data may be published only if specifically authorized by the data use agreement with the data owner.

*Sharing*:  Level 4 data may be shared only if specifically authorized by the data use agreement with the data owner.

*Disposal*:  Level 4 data shall be disposed of in the manner specified in the data use agreement with the data owner.
